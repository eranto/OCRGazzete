The project aimed to automatically extract trademark images from the papers and correspondingly match them to an application record in an existing database, with a focus on minimizing the error rate in classification. The pertinent data that needs to be extracted from the newspaper, highlighted in yellow in Figure 2, includes the application number, class number, applicant, application date, country, city, and trademark image.
